**Simulation of a 5-bit CPU in Digital Simulator and Verification of Its Correctness Using Sample Code
Stored in ROM**

A 3-bit CPU was simulated using a digital simulator and verified by executing sample code stored in
ROM.
The CPU supports OR, ADD, and SHR operations, with 5 registers, a 9-word RAM (18-bit word size), and
instructions including register-based, immediate, and branching (JMP, JL).
